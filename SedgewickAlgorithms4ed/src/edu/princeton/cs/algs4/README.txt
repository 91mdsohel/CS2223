In the Sedgewick (4ed) book, the printed code depends on a number of classes 
that were placed in the default Java package. While this makes it easier (in a way) 
to format the book, it makes it hard for the class since it would require all students
to write code in the default package.

For grading purposes, each student will place their code in a package called by their
individual user id. Fortunately, Sedgewick posted new classes as of August 2015 which
are in their own package. 

Simply add "import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.*;" to the header of your Java classes 
and you will have access to these classes.

Note: I made a few internal changes to support my Shell command, but otherwise these are 
identical to the published versions.
