Sedgewick (4ed) depends on a number of classes that are placed in the default Java package. While
this makes it easier (in a way) to write code, it makes it harder because this would force 
every student to write Java code in the default package. For grading purposes, each student
will place their code in a package called by their individual user id. Thus, this package
is a drop-in replacement for the existing classes. 

Simply add "import algs.sedgewick.*;" to the header of your Java classes and you will have access
to these classes.
