Stack Exercise

One way to solve this is to go ahead and try to come up with a sequence of push and pop
operations. Note that the input digits all have to be in descending order from 9 to 0

a. 8 7 6 5 4 3 0 1 2 9
 
	9 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 1 0 - - - -

b. 5 3 1 2 4 6 7 0 9 8

Look for out of sequence digits. If the final digit of the output is a 8, you can ask
yourself what happened to the zero? It must have already been popped off; but for this
to happen, there there is no way that the 5 was the first digit to appear on the output. 
Think about it this way, for the 5 to be the first value output, then "9 8 7 6" must all
have been pushed onto the stack, and still remain there; thus 9 must appear after 8.

c. 7 4 3 2 5 1 0 6 8 9

 	9 8 7 - 6 5 4 - 3 - 2 - - 1 - 0 - - - -

d. 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 

	9 8 7 6 5 - - - - - 4 3 2 1 0 - - - - -


e. 5 6 7 8 9 4 3 2 1 0

	9 8 7 6 5 - - - - - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - 0 -


f. 9 5 3 4 6 1 8 2 7 0 

Since 9 and 5 are the first two values popped off (in that order) then just before
popping the 5, the stack contains (in this order): "8 7 6" where 6 is on the top
of the stack and the next to be popped. Which means that 7 must popped off of the 
stack before 8. However, in the above output, 8 appears before 7, so this is impossible.

g. 8 5 2 0 1 3 4 6 9 7

This has an ALMOST valid sequence. Since "8 5" are popped in order, this means that "9 7 6"
are on the stack in this order. However, in the output representation, the 9 comes before
the 7, which is impossible given this stack.

h. 7 8 5 6 3 4 1 2 0 9 

	9 8 7 - - 6 5 - - 4 3 - - 2 1 - - 0 - -
