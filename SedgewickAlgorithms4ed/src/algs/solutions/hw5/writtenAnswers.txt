connected is satisfied by a DFS search

Sample graph with five vertices whose complement is connected.

  A ---C       A : B C E
  |\           B : A D
  | \          C : A
  B  \         D : B E
  |   \        E : A D

  D-----E
  
  A     C       A : D
  |    /|\      B : C E
  |   / | |     C : B D E
  |  B  | |     D : A C 
  |   \ | |     E : B C
  |    \| |
  D     E |
   \______|
   
Both graphs are connected.

2. Status injective graphs

use BFS to compute the distances and then accumulate. Must iterate
over all vertices to accomplish this.

For Bonus question, there are no 6-vertex SIJ graphs. However the existing explorer finds
7, 8 and 9 graphs.

Q3. Graph Proof

a. Students are asked to prove that every connected undirected graph contains 
some safe vertex whose removal will not disconnect the graph.

The claim is that given a graph with N+1 vertices that is connected, we 
can always find a vertex whose removal will give us an N vertex connected
graph.

Start by observing that a proper depth first search of a connected graph
will visit every vertex in the graph and mark it accordingly so it won't
be visited again.

Thus given a graph with N+1 vertices that is connected, consider what 
happens in the DFS search when it is about to visit (and mark) the 
final vertex, sv, which stands for safe vertex. In this case, the existing 
N marked vertices are all reachable from the initial source vertex, s.  
In addition, this final vertex, sf, has at least one edge to it, otherwise
the original graph of N+1 vertices would not have been connected. In fact, 
for all edges that connect to sv you know that they are coming from vertices
that have already been marked. So now you can see that the N marked vertices
forms a subgraph of connected vertices (they are all marked during the DFS)
and this vertex sf is only connected to marked vertices and it is the last
vertex to be unmarked. If you remove it, you will be left with a graph
of N vertices, each of which is marked and therefore represents a connected
graph.

This is a case of mathematical reductive reasoning, not inductive. The 
base cases presented are there to explain that with a graph containing
a single vertex, we assume that it is connected and we can remove this
vertex and you would be left with an empty graph, which by definition
we will consider is connected.
